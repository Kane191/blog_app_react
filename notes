This is where I'll be writing what I wish to achieve through this app, a to do 
list of what needs to be done and what is done so far.
It will also have a mini documentation of how it works 







Mini documentation

    TO RUN CLIENT : cd client, npm start
    TO RUN SERVER : cd server, npm server




Learned today

    for the server, you need to keep listening to the server. 
    That is how it is able to save real time.
    Also to use npm start on server you need to rename your main file server.js
    or add a script to your package.json eg:

        "scripts": {
            "start": "node your-script.js"
        }
